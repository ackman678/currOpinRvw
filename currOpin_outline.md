# Activity dependent development of maps in the visual system #

Our focus will be on activity-dependent development in the visual system before vision. See recent reviews for coverage of the molecular mechanisms underlying visual map development [#Cang:2013].

Cang and Feldheim Ann Rev Neurosci 2013 review [#Cang:2013]:

* Fig1 Schematic of multimap alignment (somatosensory, visual) in SC
* Fig2 Schematic of ephrinA/ephA countergradients in the retina, LGN, SC, and V1
* Fig3 Schematic of retinotopy study methods-- focal DiI injections and intrinsic signal imaging
* Fig4 Schematic of binocular alignment of retinotopy, ipsi and contra reversed N-T axis targeting for visuotopy and center out ephA gradients
	* center out gradient (proposed by Sperry 1963) found for ephA found in developing retinas of human and ferrets ([#Huberman:2005]; Lambot2005)
	* difficult to demonstrate in mice because of small number of RGCs projecting ipsilaterally (but Feldheim2000, Fig6c indicates it may infact be there)
* Binocular matching of orientation tuning
	* Hubel and Wiesel 1962, single cortical neurons are binocular yet selective for stimulus orientation and tuned to similar orientation through both eyes
	* in carnivores and primates neurons with similar orientation preferences organized into columns (Hubel and Wiesel 1962; Grinvald 1986; Blasdel 1986)
	* ...and the maps of orientation columns are binocularly matched [#Crair:1998]
	* Two models?
		* Hubel and Wiesel 1962 feed forward model
			* orientation selectivity arises from arrangement of geniculate inputs and each neurons' preference determined by layout of elongated ON and OFF subregions in their receptive field
		* Feed back models
			* orientation selectivity is an emergent property of intracortical circuitry (Adorjan 1999; Ben-Yishai 1997; Somers 1995)
	* Development
		* orientation selectivity develops after retintopic mapping and eye specific segregation in dLGN and matures after eye opening ([#Espinosa:2012] [#Huberman:2008a]) 
			* mice have no orientation columns but id. V1 neurons are highly selective [#Niell:2008] and prefer matched orientations through both eyes ([#Wang:2010b]; [#Sarnaik:2013])
			* binocular matching of orientation preference depends on vision in mice [#Sarnaik:2013],  but significant ON-OFF subregion binocular correspondence exists independent of visual experience [#Sarnaik:2013]

	* non-mammalian vertebrates
	* invertebrates 
* <del>**ignore this Sensory literature for now-**- too much literature for a  2000 word review limit?</del>
	* *limit review to before vision onset?*
	* just do very brief overview in intro with statement that here we focus on intrinsic activity patterns in visual system and refer to other recent reviews?
* When?
	* Before eye opening and experienced visual patterns

* What?
	* species
		* amniote vertebrates
			* can occur before vision-- long gestational timecourse (at least 20-30+ d. before locomotor and visuomotor behavior).
		* non-amniote vertebrates
			* does not occur before vision-- short gestation (only a 3-6 d. before start of locomotor and visuomotor behavior).
	* patterns
		* in vitro
			* early development - before eye opening
				* Retinal waves
					* Occur in all amniote species examined (turtle, chicken, rodent, rabbit, ferret, cat) [#Wong:1999], including monkey [#Warland:2006]
						* chicken E13–E18, up to 4x4mm FOV imaging with 2.5x [#Wong:1998]  629x864µm E6 nothing, E8-E11: spontaneous bursting activity. Gap junction waves [#Catsicas:1998]
						* turtle [#Sernagor:1995][#Sernagor:1996][#Sernagor:1999]
							* Turtle ganglion cells fire spontaneous bursts from embryonic stage 22 (~20 days before hatching or 40 days through gestation)[#Sernagor:1996] citing [#Sernagor:1995].

						* cat [#Meister:1991]. 2 cats, E52, P1 (E52 cat = P10 ferret)

					* Do not occur in amphibians [#Demas:2012]
						* Xenopus laevis tadpoles wildtype and albino
						* Microelectrode array recordings
						* Visually evoked responses as soon as RGCs innervate targets (unlike mammals)
						* Authors conclude that the two branches of tetrapods (amphibians and amniotes), evolved different strategies to mediate activity-dependent development during visual system formation
						* Studied 3 distinct stages: Stages 39-40 (2.25 d.p.f), Stage 46 (4 d.p.f), Stages 59-62 (45-49 d.p.f.)
				* Subplate --
					* Subplate neurons are likely key to relaying oscillatory activity to developing cortical neurons Kanold and Luhmann review [#Kanold:2010] *Nice Ann Rev Neuosci review with summary table of references for species, cortical area, neurotransmitter, etc)*
						* SPn removal in visual cortex prevents thalamocortical synapse maturation, maturation of inhibition in L4, develeopment of orientation selectivity, and formation of ODCs [#Kanold:2010]
						* physiology evidence for activity relay in vitro and in vivo in somatosensory cortex
						* physiology evidence for activity relay in vitro cat visual cortex (old disynaptic response Friauf&Shatz 1991 paper, possibly Hanganu 2001, 2002, and Hirsch &Luhmann2008)
					* Ghosh/Kanold/Shatz subplate kainic acid excitotoxicity or immunotoxin work in cats suggests that subplate cells play a key role in ocular dominance column formation, but not known if this role is activity-dependent [#Ghosh:1990][#Ghosh:1992][#Kanold:2003]
						* <del>P. Kanold</del> *No one knows if subplate cells in occipital cortex exhibit spontaneous activity during development*
						* Only subplate cells in somatosensory cortex have been checked for spontaneous activity (Luhmann, Hanganu, also Kanold JNS 2012 work) [#Hanganu:2001][#Hanganu:2002][#Dupont:2006][#Kanold:2006][#Tolner:2012]
				* Calcium waves
					* have been observed in several areas of rodent lateral and medial entorhinal cortex, temporal cortex, and fronto-parietal cortex, but none of the following groups (Konnerth, Peinado, Moody, Yuste/Ikegaya) has checked occiptial cortex before eye opening: 
						* <del>[#Garaschuk:2000], [#Peinado:2000], [#Corlew:2004], [#Namiki:2013]</del> *None of these groups has done occipital cortex in vitro*
			* after eye opening

					* average interval of synchronous population events was 55 ± 4 s (peak synchrony in histograms, considerably slower than slow oscillations of 0.1 - 0.5 Hz)
		* in vivo
			* early development - before eye opening
				* Rat
					* Correlated bursting among RGCs [#Maffei:1990]

						* spindle shaped field potential oscillations in visual cortex [#Hanganu:2006]
					* 'Slow activity transients'
						* infra-slow LFP wave with nested fast oscillations
							* field oscillations and bursting multiunit activity in visual cortex [#Colonnese:2010]
								* 87% of L4 MUA occured during slow activity transients
								* extracellular recordings with glass electrode or multisite silicon probe
									* age P5-P7
										* peak frequency (8 - 31 Hz, mostly 18-30 Hz) and duration form single distribution (400 ms - 5 s), likely all continuous 'spindle burst' oscillations within the slow wave 
									* age P9-P13
										* short duration events (<400 ms) first prominent around P9-P10 and increased frequency of these events until becoming the most common type by P13
										* very long duration (>5 s) encountered after P8 ('splitting of events with maturation')
										* two populations of events encountered:
											* long duration, beta band frequency (>5 s, 18-30 Hz)
											* short duration, alpha band frequency (<3 s, 10 Hz)
										* after P12 SATs less common and no longer dominant pattern-- continuous cortical activity and slow wave sleep (delta)

				* Mouse
					* retinal waves
						* Primary source of patterned activity throughout neonatal visual system [#Ackman:2012]
						* Retinal input modulates synchronous calcium signals in cortical neurons [#Siegel:2012]

				* Binocular matching of orientation preference depends on vision in mice [#Sarnaik:2013],  but significant ON-OFF subregion binocular correspondence develops completely independent of visual experience [#Sarnaik:2013]

									* HP Xu recent work?
							* Independent of NMDA-R?
								* endocannabinoid induced LTD?
									* but this type of activation still requires NMDA activation? [#Duguid:2006]
										* this type of coincidence detection reviewed elsewhere [#Duguid:2006]
								* mGluR-VSCC-IP3R-eCB coincidence detector [#Bender:2006]
									* this form of LTD independent of postsynaptic NMDA receptors
									* utilizes metabotropic glutamate receptors, voltage sensitive calcium channels, IP3 stores, and endocannabinoid receptors
									* detects firing coincidence at 125 ms time scale (*versus 25 ms time scale for NMDA dependent LTP*)
									* described at L4 to L2/3 synapses in somatosensory cortex
								* bistable switch in spike statistics for postsynaptic neurons? 
									* critical level of coincident presynaptic activity needed to cause spike?
										* during early development?
											* biophysical membrane and cable properties different in immature neurons
												* more voltage gated calcium conductance
												* less sodium channels
											* lower fidelity spike transmission initially?
						* Non-coincident -- alternate, lagged timing based plasticity rule?
				* Spatial activity pattern
					* Unknown: no direct experiment yet
						* experiment needed: to control spatio-temporal activity patterns before start of vision

				* Spatiotemporal information in retinal waves TODO: make table of these properties?
					* *Perform quick analysis of wavefront size within our in vivo waves dataset and include as a new data in a Figure?*
					* Wave speed from in vitro and in vivo literature consistent (100s of microns/sec) 
						* retina in vitro (100 - 500 µm/s; mouse, rabbit, ferret, monkey) TODO: zhou, feller, feldheim, chalupa papers
						* SC in vivo (28 - 60 µm/s = 90 - 180 µm/s in retina with 3x scale factor) [#Ackman:2012]
					* Wave size (wave area) smaller within in vitro literature [#Stafford:2009] and bigger in vivo [#Ackman:2012]
						* Wave propagation failure in vitro because of some combination of in vitro conditions such as bath medium, temperature, and cut connections?
					* Wave direction along VT - DN axis in vitro [#Stafford:2009] and in vivo [#Ackman:2012]
						* This makes the wavefront axis perpindicular to preferred axis for activity mediated refinement
