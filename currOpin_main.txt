# Role of emergent neural activity in visual map development


# Abstract

The structural and functional development of visual circuits in reptiles, birds, and mammals happens largely independent of sensory experience. Innate genetic programs code for gradients of molecules which provide gross positional information for developing nerve cells, yet much of the cytoarchitectural complexity and synaptogenesis of neurons depends on calcium influx, neurotransmitter release, and neural activity before the start of vision. In fact, specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity, or 'retinal waves', emerge amidst the development of the earliest connections made between excitable cells in the developing eye. These patterns of spontaneous activity, which have been observed in all amniote retinae examined to date, may be an evolved adaptation for species with long gestational periods before the onset of functional vision, imparting an informational robustness and redundancy for the development of visual maps across the nervous system. Recent experiments indicate that retinal waves play a crucial role in the development of interconnections between different parts of the visual system, suggesting that these spontaneous patterns serve as a template-matching mechanism to prepare higher-order visually-associative circuits for the onset of visuomotor learning and behavior. Key questions for future studies include determining the exact sources and nature of spontaneous activity during development, characterizing the interactions between neural activity and transcriptional gene regulation, and understanding the extent of circuit connectivity governed by retinal waves within and between sensory-motor systems.



# Introduction

The visual system is organized such that information relayed through the optic nerve is processed in a set of hierarchal neural maps distributed throughout the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebral cortex. As with all biological tissues, construction of the circuits underlying these visual maps fundamentally depends on innate genetic programs. However, the nervous system is unique with the extent to which it can be shaped by changes in the external world detected and relayed as nerve impulses by the sensory organs. This extraordinary plasticity of the nervous system was underscored in the visual deprivation experiments by Hubel and Wiesel on ocular dominance column development in visual cortex [#Hubel:1977a] and was experienced by each of us as we first learned our native language. 

Given the many pieces of information that must be parsed from the photic signals in the eye to deconstruct and reconstruct the visual scene, one might think that visual experience is absolutely required to establish these visual representations. The debate between Herring and von Helmholz in the 19th century over whether the binocular coordination of eye movements [#King:2000] required for stereoscopic vision was innate or learned highlighted the always relevant problem regarding the roles for nature and nurture in developmental neuroscience. Though complex brain and behavioral development in the absence of learned experience is not surprising in animals – e.g. infant suckling in newborns – it is still remarkable that a considerable amount of intricate visual circuit structure and function forms before any patterned visual experience. As noted by Hubel and Wiesel [#Hubel:1977a] based on their recordings from primary visual cortex in newborn monkey:

> That area 17 is in so many respects wired up and ready to go when the animal is born is perhaps not so surprising if one remembers that the machinery of area 17 represents building blocks of vision...

Indeed both their studies and subsequent work by others has demonstrated that a number of visual maps are formed by the time of birth or eyelid opening including cortical maps for retinotopy, orientation selectivity, direction selectivity <!--this isn't true for direction selectivity in ferrets, careful-->, and ocular dominance. Thus, with so many circuits established before birth it might seem that by knowing the genetic code and its patterns of expression we would understand all the instructions underlying visual map formation.

However, the genetic code does not work in isolation-- the information required for organism development stems from the myriad interactions that occur within and outside of the cellular environment throughout the course of gestation. A factor that may be particularly relevant to the development and function of the nervous system is that spontaneous electrical activity and neurotransmitter release emerges among excitable cells in the developing nervous system, even in isolated cultures of immature neurons. Intriguingly, a number of studies have provided experimental evidence that specific *patterns* of neural activity are required for proper visual map formation in rodent, ferret, and cat indicating that spontaneous activity occurs in the immature nervous system and has a clear function in circuit development. These spontaneous patterns of activity increase the informational complexity that the genome can carry by serving to sculpt neural architecture and synaptic connections so that the nervous system can begin performing computations relevant for visual behavior, learning, and memory at the start of vision. Indeed, as any mother who has felt their baby kick inside the womb can attest, the developing brain is not quiet. And pediatric neurologists would direct our attention to the fetal brain malformations which occur when chemicals that interfere with neurotransmission are taken during pregnancy.

In this review we discuss recent work that highlights the function of spontaneous activity in visual system development. We will focus on studies that have examined the nature of spontaneous activity in the developing brain as well as studies that have provided direct experimental evidence for the function of retinal waves in visual map development. We refer the reader to recent reviews on the crucial roles of molecular signaling gradients, such as Eph/Ephrins for visual circuit development [#Huberman:2008a] [Cang and Feldheim Annual Review 2013], as well as on the mechanisms by which patterned spontaneous activity is generated within developing neural circuits [#Blankenship:2010], and how activity shapes circuit development after the onset of patterned vision [Levelt and Hubener Annual Review 2012].







# Spontaneous activity in the visual system: What, When, and Where? 

Spontaneous oscillations play a prominent yet unclear role in brain function. Though it is unknown precisely how spontaneous oscillations of electrical activity arise within immature networks, there are numerous examples demonstrating that they do-- such as the spontaneous activity found in cultures of isolated neurons [#Mazzoni:2007], as well as immmature spinal cord [#Marder:2005], retina [#Maffei:1990,Meister:1991], and cortical circuits [#Leinekugel:2002,Khazipov:2006]. The function of spontaneous correlated activity may be to strengthen the synaptic weights between coactive cells through voltage-dependent calcium influx that mediates downstream changes in transcriptional regulation. Adjustments in gene expression could result in synaptic modifications through changes in ion channel or neurotransmitter receptor function, changes in receptor clustering at existing synapses, or formation of entirely new synapses with nearby cells.

So when and where do these spontaneous activities occur that can mediate these developmental changes? Spontaneous oscillations occur after eye opening and maturation of the visual system is complete, such as standing waves and fast travelling waves [#Benucci:2007][#Han:2008] that may serve a purpose in experiential pattern replay during sleep, such as occurs with the replay activations of place cells in the hippocampus [#Lee:2002]. Yet spontaneous activity also occurs in the visual system before the onset of visual experience in all amniote species that have been examined [#Wong:1999]. Thus travelling 'retinal waves' of spiking activity sweep across the retina before hatching or birth in a variety of species including chicken, turtle, rabbit, monkey, rodent and cat (Table 1?). In some species that are particularly immature at birth, such as rodent, rabbit, cat and ferret, retinal waves continue postnatally before eye lid opening. Thus amniote vertebrates have a long gestational timecourse that provides the opportunity, and potentially the necessity, for these patterns of spontaneous activity to develop. In non-amniote vertebrates, there is a short gestational timecourse before the beginning of locomotor and visuomotor behavior, so the roles subserved by spontaneous driven patterned activity can be be mediated primarily by sensory dependent activation, and spontaneous waves are absent [Demas, Payne and Cline, 2012].

What kind of activity is occurring elsewhere in the visual system during development? In the white matter and cortical layer 6 a transient populaiton of cells called subplate neurons are thought to play a key role in cortical development. Subplate neurons may relay input activity patterns to immature cortical neurons that have yet to form functional synapses with thalamic axons  [#Kanold:2010]. Several experiments using pharmacology and targeted ablation of subplate neurons indicate that this cell population is important for synapse maturationn, maturation of inhibition in L4, development of orientation selectivity, and formation of ocular dominance columns [#Kanold:2010]. Evidence that subplate neurons form a disynaptic relay between thalamocortical inputs and developing cortical neurons is suggested by in vitro recordings in kitten visual cortex (Friauf&Shatz 1991 paper) and from in vitro and in vivo recoridngs in rodent somatosensory cortex (Hanganu, luhmann, Kanold work). Subplate neurons have been demonstrated to be spontaneously active in somatosensory cortex, but it unknown in visual cortex. But what about in vivo?

Spontaneous calcium waves have been observed in vitro in several areas of rodent lateral and medial entorhinal cortex, temporal cortex, and fronto-parietal cortex [#Garaschuk:2000], [#Peinado:2000], [#Corlew:2004], [#Namiki:2013]. Spontaneous UP-DOWN states have been recorded after eye opening between P14-P21 in mouse visual cortex using calcium imaging and patch recordings in vitro [#Cossart:2003]

Though in vitro experiments are very powerful at dissecting local circuits, ultimately an understanding of the nature and function of neural activity in a complex and extended neural circuit must be achieved in the intact system. To this end, increasingly refined in vivo analysis of activity patterns during early development have been recorded in the visual system of ferrets and rodents.
 
Indeed, in EEG recordings from occipital cortex in preterm human infants, infra-slow LFP waves with nested fast oscillations have been demonstrated [#Vanhatalo:2005][#Colonnese:2010a] and are thought to be homologous to the 'slow activity transients' (SATs) shown to exist using extracellular recordings in rat visual cortex before eye opening [#Colonnese:2010]. During early development to before eye opening, 87% of spiking activity in L4 occurs within the field potential oscillations of SATs, which are sensitive to the presence of retinal input, suggesting that they are likely triggered by the spiking activity that occurs between local RGCs [#Maffei:1990] during retinal waves [#Meister:1990][#Ackman:2012].

Recent calcium imaging studies have proved invaluable for revealing the spatial patterns of spontaneous activity in the visual system. The first in vivo recordings of retinal waves was recently accomplished by recording pre-synaptic calcium signals from RGC terminals in the superior colliculus in mice. Together with post-synaptic recordings from populations of collicular and cortical neurons, these experiments reveal that retinal waves are the primary source of patterned neural activity throughout the developing visual system before vision[#Ackman:2012], providing spatially consistent information about retinotopic and eye specific organization to multiple hierarchial circuits. These experiments also highlight the importance of examining spontaneous activity in the intact animal, as several fundamental features of retinal waves, such as wave size and direction, are quite different from that observed in reduced (in vitro) preparations. Multicellular two-photon calcium imaging from local clusters of visual cortical neurons also shows that retinal input modulates synchronous calcium signals in cortical neurons [#Siegel:2012]. Much of the work in this study was done under light anesthetic conditions, which blocks retinal wave generation [#Ackman:2012][#Colonnese:2010], so it is uncertain whether the recordings reflect spindle burst oscillations [#Hanganu:2006] or synchronous bursting activity in V2, which can activate V1 cells in the border regions of V1 [#Ackman:2012]. In fact, spindle bursts oscillations may be the the LFP representation of these synchronous, short duration calcium activations recorded in V2 and along the V1/V2 border recorded by [#Ackman:2012]. Variability in the stereotaxic targeting of brain areas during development without visually driven responses to map area borders raises some uncertainty about the interpretation of these experiments <--- I don't like this too much...---->. In the future, it will be important to combine targeted extracellular electrophysiological recordings with wide-field and two-photon calcium imaging to establish a coherent understanding of the different activity patterns described with the different LFP and imaging approaches. This is crucial because it is unclear if these patterns are truly different, or just a limitation of recording with extracellular field potentials whose spatial resolution and range of constituent components are uncertain, or possibly a limitation in the temporal resolution of current imaging techniques.  Some or all of the spindle burst oscillations and continuous cortical activity described in visual cortex [#Hanganu:2006][#Colonnese:2010] may occur indpendent of retinal waves, and and may predominate in secondary visual cortical areas, representing intra-cortically generated patterns or feedback from multimodal areas such as portions of V2 which can exhibit visual and somatosensory responses and spindle bursts attributed to developing tactile-motor neuron development in the somatosensory system.

Just before and around eye opening, several lines of evidence suggest that the pattern of activity that predominates in the visual system is markedly different than earlier in development. In vivo recordings in ferrets show that correlated bursting acivity among LGN nad V1 neurons is modulated, but not exclusively driven by retinal input [#Weliky:1999][#Chiu:2002]. In rat, the SATs encountered earlier in development still predominate, but the patterns split into two populations, a longer duration, higher frequency bursting and a short duration, lower frequency bursting [#Colonnese:2010]. Just before eye opening SATs become less common and are no longer the predominate pattern, with continuous cortical activity and slow wave sleep becoming dominant [#Colonnese:2010].






# Regulation of cellular anatomy and physiology by spontaneous activity

Though visual experience has a clear role in directing the refinement of synaptic connectivity, much of the coarse topography of neural circuits is established by molecular signalling early in development, before viable sensory-driven activity. For example, signalling gradients via Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands mediate much of the rostro-caudal and medio-lateral targeting of retinal ganglion cell afferents within the superior colliculus/optic tectum [#Lemke:2005]. The initial connectivity between axons and their target cells produces functional neuronal networks that are appropriate enough to make some aspects of visual processing available before the onset of sensory experience, such as retinotopy, ocular dominance, and orientation selectivity in the optic tectum and visual cortex [#Rakic:1976,Holt:1983,Crair:1998,Crowley:2000].

Important aspects of this functional synapse maturation at retinogeniculate (Hooks and Chen, 2006) and retinocollicular (Shah and Crair, 2008) synapses are dependent on spontaneous activity. At the retinogeniculate synapse, blockade of spontaneous activity by TTX application to the eye around and before the time of eye opening, prevents the normal developmental increase in synapse strength and arrests synaptic pruning (Hooks and Chen, 2006). Visual deprivation (by delaying eye opening) has no effect. Functional maturation at the retinocollicular synapse is also impaired in β2-nAChR KO (β2-/-) mice during the first week after birth (Shah and Crair, 2008), again suggesting that spontaneous retinal activity promotes the maturation of retinogufal synapses before normal vision is possible. During the developmental window that retinocollicular and retinogeniculate synapse maturation is sensitive to ongoing spontaneous activity, these synapses also exhibit long-term potentiation and depression (LTP/LTD) (Butts et al., Shah and Crair, 2008), suggesting that Hebbian mechanisms may mediate the activity-dependent development of retinofugal synapses. Furthermore, the morphological development of neurons in the superior colliculus is shaped by activity through a competitive process (Furman and Crair, 2012; Furman, Xu and Crair, 2013), strengthening the mechanistic link between activity-dependent synapse development and the structural maturation of synapses and neurons.

The development of neural circuits or 'maps' for visual stimulus features, such as retinotopy, ocular dominance and orientation, are also sensitive to the presence of ongoing spontaneous activity before eye opening. Disrupting retinal waves pharmacologically or genetically interferes with the development of both retinotopy and eye specific segregation in the dLGN and SC of mice [#McLaughlin:2003][#Chandrasekaran:2005][#Stellwagen:2002]. In the SC, retinocollicular target zones and individual axon arbors are enlarged in β2-/- mice, and preferentially elongated along the nasal-temporal axis of the retina, corresponding to the visual field azimuth [#Chandrasekaran:2005]; Dhande et a., 2011). Functional response properties of SC neurons are correspondingly impacted, with receptive fields dramatically enlarged, particularly along the visual field azimuth [#Chandrasekaran:2005][#Mrsic-Flogel:2005]. In the dLGN of in β2-/- mice, retinal ganglion cell axon arbors are also modestly enlarged [#Dhande:2011] <!--(pharmacology done???)-->, but rather than expanded receptive fields in individual dLGN neurons, the overall retinotopic map is disrupted due to the scatter of receptive field locations, particularly along the visual field azimuth [#Grubb:2003].  Remarkably, in both the dLGN [#Grubb:2003] and SC [#Chandrasekaran:2005] of β2-/- mice, the organization of response properties associated with on- or off-selectivity, which are not normally observed in mice, emerge de novo. In the dLGN, on- and off-center cells are spatially segregated [#Grubb:2003], while in the SC, neurons become selective to either the onset or the offset of light stimulus, when they normally respond equally well to both. Thus, it appears that circuit organization around new response features emerge in the dLGN and SC of β2-/- mice, possibly because of the delayed functional development of retinofugal synapses [#Hooks:2006][#Shah:2008] and the precocious presence of Stage III (glutamate receptor mediated) waves in β2-/- mice [#Bansal:2000], which have distinct correlation properties in  on- and off- retinal ganglion cells (Wong lab). 

Disruptions in neural circuit development in β2-/- mice are not confined to first order, retinofugal connections. Anatomical and functional response properties in higher order visual circuits, including geniculo-cortical connections [#Cang:2005] and cortico-collicular connections [#Triplett:2009] are also perturbed. Moreover, the anatomical and functional receptive field anomalies in in β2-/- mice are accompanied by behavioral deficits in visual function (Wang et al., 2009 from Cang lab). While anatomical and functional visual deficits in  β2-/- mice are widespread and robust, the presence and nature of the disruption in spontaneous retinal waves in β2-/- mice remains uncertain and controversial (Feller lab, Feldheim lab, Chalupa lab). However, several other models in mice that appear to disrupt spontaneous retinal activity and visual circuit development have also recently emerged. These genetic manipulations perturb ongoing retinal activity in a variety of ways, and appear to cause corresponding disruptions in visual circuit development (nob mice - Guido; Picciotto mice - Xu et al., others?). The results of pharmacological manipulations in mice (epibatidine - Chandrasekaran ), ferrets [#Stellwagen:2002]; [#Huberman:2006] and cats are also generally consistent with genetic manipulations, though some contradictions persist (Huberman et al. 2003 with Chalupa as senior author). Resolution of lingering uncertainties about the precise role of spontaneous retinal activity in the emergence of visual circuits will require a careful analysis of spontaneous activity in vivo in the various genetic and pharmacological models, and a parametric analysis of the role of activity in the development of the diverse features of visual circuitry, including retinotopy and eye segregation. 

In addition to maps for retinotopy and ocular dominance, visual circuits for orientation and emerge without vision [#Crair:1998] [Li et al., 2006 Fitzpatrick lab] [#Serniak:2013]. Binocular matching of orientation preference also occurs without vision in cats and ferrets [#Crair:1998] [Li et al., 2006 Fitzpatrick lab], though in mice orientation matching is degraded without vision [#Serniak:2013]. Furthermore, in ferrets direction selectivity requires visual experience [Li et al., 2006], while in mice direction selectivity in cortex is independent of vision [#Rochefort:2011]. Differences between ferret, cat and mice in the apparent role of vision in the emergence of various visual receptive field properties could be due differences in the neural circuits underlying these response features (mice don't have orientation maps, though they do have orientation selective cells), or differences in the developmental timing or properties of spontaneous activity in these various species.
