# Activity dependent development of maps in the visual system #


## Activity type

* Sensory
	* species
		* mammals
		* non-mammalian vertebrates
		* invertebrates 
	* <del>**ignore this Sensory literature for now-**- too much literature for a  2000 word review limit?</del>
		* just do very brief overview in intro with statement that here we focus on intrinsic activity patterns in visual system and refer to other recent reviews?
	* When?
		* Before eye opening and experienced visual patterns
			* Melanopsin
		* After eye opening
			* Hubel and Wiesel
* Spontaneous
	* What?
		* species
			* mammals
				* can occur before vision-- long gestational timecourse
			* non-mammalian vertebrates
				* does not occur before vision-- short gestation
		* described patterns in vitro
			* retinal waves
				* neonate - late postnatal
					* TODO: shatz, Wong, Feller work
					* TODO: J. Zhou work
		* described patterns in vivo
			* early development - before eye opening
				* rat
					* TODO: Konnerth fiber optic calcium imaging
				* mouse
			* before eye opening
				* ferret
					* TODO: Weliky literature in LGN and cortex
			* <del>after eye opening</del>
				* **much literature in adult**
					* monkey, cat, ferret, rodent, etc
				* patterned activity
					* TODO: Recent Konnerth peri-eye opening calcium imaging paper
					* intrinsic signal imaging
						* Stryker work
						* A. Grinvald work
					* multicell recordings
					* any mutlichannel recordings in newborn monkey (hubel wiesel just did single electrodes?)
		
			* rodent
			* ferret
			* retinal waves
				* neonate
					* TODO: our paper
		 			* TODO: Lohmann Curr biolol paper
			* 'spindle' bursts
				* neonate - late postnatal
					* 
			* <del>fast traveling waves</del>
				* adult
	* Where?
		* retina
			* TODO: our paper
		* LGN
			* TODO: Shatz ex vivo paper
			* TODO: our paper
		* superior colliculus
			* TODO: our paper
		* visual cortex
			* TODO: our paper
			* TODO: Lohmann Curr biolol paper
	* When?
		* Before eye opening and experienced visual patterns
			* Before birth for some species
			* After birth for some species
		* After eye opening
			* experiential pattern replay/dreams
				* analogs to hippocampal - place cell replays for learning and memory?
	* Why?
		* activity dependent visual map development
			* anatomical - structural
				* axon sprouting
					* xenopus, zebrafish literature?
					* LGN and SC
						* rodent
							* mouse
								* TODO: beta2 nAchR ko mouse
								* TODO: N. Spitzer reference on activity-dep Ca2+ growth
				* axon refinement
					* xenopus, zebrafish literature?
					* LGN and SC
						* rodent
							* mouse
								* TODO: beta2 nAchR ko mouse
				* dendrite growth?
					* cortical-tectal recepient cells in SC, 
						* TODO: recent constantine-paton paper
					* Golgi or DiI analysis in ferret, cat, monkey, or rodent cortex?
					* Golgi or DiI analysis in LGN or SC?
				* dendritic refinement
					* spine dynamics?
						* TODO: xenopus literature?, H. Cline
				* cell migration
					* rodent
						* cortex
							* interneurons
								* TODO: recent Fishell paper
								* TODO: recent ZJ Huang papers
								* TODO: Ben-Ari, JB Manent activity dependent interneuron migration in vitro model
					* higher mammals
						* cortex
							* TODO: Chalupa monkey retinal wave evidence and ferret in vitro
							* unknown but gestational times for both excitatory and inhibitory cell migration overlaps significantly with likely period for retinal waves
			* functional - physiological 
				* microcircuit
					* direction selectivity
						* TODO: Recent Konnerth peri-eye opening calcium imaging paper
						* TODO: Recent Fitzpatrick work (the reprogramming of selectivity)
					* orientation selectivity
						* TODO: Crair, Stryker
						* TODO: Recent Fitzpatrick work
						* TODO: ongoing J. Cang unpublished work? (look at abstr from SFN, our CSHL conf last year)
				* macrocircuit
					* TODO: A. Huberman ferret epibatidine work on ODCs
