# Activity dependent development of maps in the visual system #


## Activity type

* Sensory
	* species
		* mammals
		* non-mammalian vertebrates
		* invertebrates 
	* <del>**ignore this Sensory literature for now-**- too much literature for a  2000 word review limit?</del>
		* just do very brief overview in intro with statement that here we focus on intrinsic activity patterns in visual system and refer to other recent reviews?
	* When?
		* Before eye opening and experienced visual patterns
			* Melanopsin
		* After eye opening
			* Hubel and Wiesel
* Spontaneous
	* What?
		* species
			* mammals
				* can occur before vision-- long gestational timecourse
			* non-mammalian vertebrates
				* does not occur before vision-- short gestation
		* patterns described in vitro
			* early development - before eye opening
				* retinal waves
					* TODO: shatz, Wong, Feller work

				 			* but most activity was independent of retinal input, and more likely 'spindle bursts' 
								* unknown if recordings were strictly from V1 or V2 (no method for identification)
								* calcium recordings were not summed population signals
				 			* *which might be same as the independent spontaneous V2 activity we saw* [#Ackman:2012]

			* around eye opening

						* Wave speed from in vitro and in vivo literature consistent (100s of microns/sec) 
							* retina in vitro (100 - 500 µm/s; mouse, rabbit, ferret, monkey) TODO: zhou, feller, feldheim, chalupa papers
							* SC in vivo (28 - 60 µm/s = 90 - 180 µm/s in retina with 3x scale factor) [#Ackman:2012]
						* Wave size (wave area) smaller within in vitro literature [#Stafford:2009] and bigger in vivo [#Ackman:2012]
							* Wave propagation failure in vitro because of in vitro conditions such as bath medium, disconnections, and/or retinal damage?
						* Wave direction along VT - DN axis in vitro [#Stafford:2009] and in vivo [#Ackman:2012]
							* This makes the wavefront axis perpindicular to preferred axis for activity mediated refinement
