# Activity dependent development of maps in the visual system #


## Activity type

### Sensory

* species
	* mammals
	* non-mammalian vertebrates
	* invertebrates 
* <del>**ignore this Sensory literature for now-**- too much literature for a  2000 word review limit?</del>
	* *limit review to before vision onset?*
	* just do very brief overview in intro with statement that here we focus on intrinsic activity patterns in visual system and refer to other recent reviews?
* When?
	* Before eye opening and experienced visual patterns
		* Melanopsin
	* After eye opening
		* Hubel and Wiesel




### Spontaneous

* What?
	* species
		* mammals
			* can occur before vision-- long gestational timecourse
		* non-mammalian vertebrates
			* does not occur before vision-- short gestation
	* patterns
		* in vitro
			* early development - before eye opening
				* retinal waves
					* Occur in all amniote species examined (turtle, chicken, rodent, rabbit, ferret, cat) [#Wong:1999], including monkey [#Warland:2006]
						* chicken [#Wong:1998][#Catsicas:1998]
						* turtle [#Sernagor:1996]
						* ferret [#Meister:1991][#Wong:1993][#Feller:1996]
						* cat [#Meister:1991]
						* rabbit [#Zhou:2000]
						* mouse [#Mooney:1996][#Bansal:2000]
						* monkey [#Warland:2006]
					* Do not occur in amphibians [#Demas:2012]
						* Xenopus laevis tadpoles wildtype and albino
						* Microelectrode array recordings
						* Visually evoked responses as soon as RGCs innervate targets (unlike mammals)
						* Authors conclude that the two branches of tetrapods (amphibians and amniotes), evolved different strategies to mediate activity-dependent development during visual system formation
				* Subplate --
					* Subplate neurons are likely key to relaying oscillatory activity to developing cortical neurons Kanold and Luhmann review [#Kanold:2010] *Nice Ann Rev Neuosci review with summary table of references for species, cortical area, neurotransmitter, etc)*
						* SPn removal in visual cortex prevents thalamocortical synapse maturation, maturation of inhibition in L4, develeopment of orientation selectivity, and formation of ODCs [#Kanold:2010]
						* physiology evidence for activity relay in vitro and in vivo in somatosensory cortex
						* physiology evidence for activity relay in vitro cat visual cortex (old disynaptic response Friauf&Shatz 1991 paper, possibly Hanganu 2001, 2002, and Hirsch &Luhmann2008)
					* Ghosh/Kanold/Shatz subplate kainic acid excitotoxicity or immunotoxin work in cats suggests that subplate cells play a key role in ocular dominance column formation, but not known if this role is activity-dependent [#Ghosh:1990][#Ghosh:1992][#Kanold:2003]
						* <del>P. Kanold</del> *No one knows if subplate cells in occipital cortex exhibit spontaneous activity during development*
						* Only subplate cells in somatosensory cortex have been checked for spontaneous activity (Luhmann, Hanganu, also Kanold JNS 2012 work) [#Hanganu:2001][#Hanganu:2002][#Dupont:2006][#Kanold:2006][#Tolner:2012]
					* Calcium waves
						* have been observed in several areas of rodent lateral and medial entorhinal cortex, temporal cortex, and fronto-parietal cortex, but none of the following groups (Konnerth, Peinado, Moody, Yuste/Ikegaya) has checked occiptial cortex before eye opening: 
							* <del>[#Garaschuk:2000], [#Peinado:2000], [#Corlew:2004], [#Namiki:2013]</del> *None of these groups has done occipital cortex in vitro*
			* after eye opening
				* UP-DOWN states in mouse visual cortex [#Cossart:2003]
					* P14-P21 C57/BL6 brain slices
					* multicellular two-photon calcium imaging with Fura2 and patch clamp recordings
					* all cortical layers 2-5 imaged
					* average interval of synchronous population events was 55 ± 4 s (peak synchrony in histograms, considerably slower than slow oscillations of 0.1 - 0.5 Hz)
		* in vivo
			* early development - before eye opening
				* Rat
					* Correlated bursting among RGCs [#Maffei:1990]
					* 'Spindle bursts'
						* spindle shaped field potential oscillations in visual cortex [#Hanganu:2006]
					* 'Slow activity transients'
						* infra-slow LFP wave with nested fast oscillations
							* field oscillations and bursting multiunit activity in visual cortex [#Colonnese:2010]
								* 87% of L4 MUA occured during slow activity transients
								* extracellular recordings with glass electrode or multisite silicon probe
									* age P5-P7
										* peak frequency (8 - 31 Hz, mostly 18-30 Hz) and duration form single distribution (400 ms - 5 s), likely all continuous 'spindle burst' oscillations within the slow wave 
									* age P9-P13
										* short duration events (<400 ms) first prominent around P9-P10 and increased frequency of these events until becoming the most common type by P13
										* very long duration (>5 s) encountered after P8 ('splitting of events with maturation')
										* two populations of events encountered:
											* long duration, beta band frequency (>5 s, 18-30 Hz)
											* short duration, alpha band frequency (<3 s, 10 Hz)
										* after P12 SATs less common and no longer dominant pattern-- continuous cortical activity and slow wave sleep (delta)

				* Mouse
					* retinal waves
						* Primary source of patterned activity throughout neonatal visual system [#Ackman:2012]
						* Retinal input modulates synchronous calcium signals in cortical neurons [#Siegel:2012]
							* they possibly recorded some retinal waves? 
							* but most activity was independent of retinal input, and more likely 'spindle bursts' 
								* unknown if recordings were strictly from V1 or V2 (no method for identification)
								* calcium recordings were not summed population signals
							* *which might be same as the independent spontaneous V2 activity we saw* [#Ackman:2012]
				* Human 
					* 'Slow activity transients'
						* infra-slow LFP wave with nested fast oscillations
