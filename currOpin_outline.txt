		* How?
			- Permissive
				* Spatiotemporal pattern does not matter
					* Perhaps just absolute levels of activity needed?
			- Informative
				* Spatiotemporal pattern does matter
					* Temporal activity pattern
						* Time scale
							* eye-specific segregation
								* before eye opening
									* synchronous activation of RGCs with ChR2 disrupts eye-specific segregation in SC and LGN [#Zhang:2011]
									* Relevant time scale -- spike timing differences of 100s of milliseconds 
										* chR2 stimulation of RGCs, anatomical segregation analysis in SC [#Zhang:2011]
							* Mechanism
								* coincident pre-post synaptic spiking activity - Hebbian
									* Dependent on NMDA-R?
										* maybe yes?
											* TODO:
											* HP Xu recent work?
										* maybe not?
											* Guido LGN work
											* HP Xu recent work?
									* Independent of NMDA-R?
										* endocannabidnoid induced LTD?
											* but this type of activation still requires NMDA activiation?
												* this type of coincidence detection reviewed elsewhere [#Duguid:2006]
										* bistable switch in spike statistics for postsynaptic neurons? 
											* critical level of coincident presynaptic activity needed to cause spike?
												* during early development?
													* biophysical membrane and cable properties different in immature neurons
														* more voltage gated calcium conductance
														* less sodium channels
													* lower fidelity spike transmission initially?
								* coincident pre-post synaptic activity without post spiking?			
					* Spatial activity pattern
						* Unknown
							* experiment needed: to control spatio-temporal activity patterns before start of vision
								* Analagous to the classic Sensory activation experiments
									* owl prism experiments Knudsen
									* cat goggle experiments
						* Instructive role of spatial activation hinted at by Hong-Ping's paper? [#Xu:2011]
						* Necessitates the temporal activity mechanisms with an additional spatial dimension
						* Spatial patterns setup in periphery (RGCs) and communicated across levels of visual organization [#Ackman:2012]
