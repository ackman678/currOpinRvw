	Abstract = {Before phototransduction, spontaneous activity in the developing mammalian retina is required for the appropriate patterning of retinothalamic connections, and there is growing evidence that this activity influences the development of circuits within the retina itself. We demonstrate here that the neural substrate that generates waves in the mouse retina develops through three distinct stages. First, between embryonic day 16 and birth [postnatal day 0 (P0)], we observed both large, propagating waves inhibited by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonists and small clusters of cells displaying nonpropagating, correlated calcium increases that were independent of nAChR activation. Second, between P0 and P11, we observed only larger propagating waves that were abolished by toxins specific to alpha3 and beta2 subunit-containing nAChRs. Third, between P11 and P14 (eye opening) we observed propagating activity that was abolished by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. The time course of this developmental shift was dramatically altered in retinas from mice lacking the beta2 nAChR subunit or the beta2 and beta4 subunits. These retinas exhibited a novel circuit at P0, no spontaneous correlated activity between P1 and P8, and the premature induction at P8 of an ionotropic glutamate receptor-based circuit. Retinas from postnatal mice lacking the alpha3 nAChR subunit exhibited spontaneous, correlated activity patterns that were similar to those observed in embryonic wild-type mice. In alpha3-/- and beta2-/- mice, the development and distribution of cholinergic neurons and processes and the density of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the gross segregation of their dendrites into ON and OFF sublaminae were normal. However, the refinement of individual RGC dendrites is delayed. These results indicate that retinal waves mediated by nAChRs are involved in, but not required for, the development of neural circuits that define the ON and OFF sublamina of the inner plexiform layer.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that electrical activity, particularly that mediated by NMDA receptors, has a profound effect on the development of specific neuronal connections. Blocking NMDA receptors in the ferret's lateral geniculate nucleus prevents the segregation of retinal afferents into ON and OFF sublaminae. We have now examined the involvement of NMDA receptors in the separation of afferents from the two eyes that occurs in the lateral geniculate nucleus several weeks earlier in development. Blockade of NMDA receptor activity does not appear to interfere with this eye-specific segregation.},

@article{Sernagor:1996,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role played by early neural activity in shaping retinal functions has not yet been established. In the developing vertebrate retina, ganglion cells fire spontaneous bursts of action potentials before the onset of visual experience. This spontaneous bursting disappears shortly after birth or eye opening. In the present study, we have investigated whether the outgrowth of receptive fields in turtle retinal ganglion cells is affected by early spontaneous bursting or by early visual experience.
RESULTS: Ganglion cells normally stop bursting spontaneously 2-4 weeks post-hatching, the time when receptive-field areas reach adult size. When turtles are reared in the dark, the spontaneous bursting persists. Concomitantly, receptive-field areas expand to more than twice those observed in normal adults. To test whether chronic blockade of spontaneous bursting inhibits the expansion of developing receptive-field areas, we have exposed the retina to curare, a nicotinic cholinergic antagonist, because spontaneous bursting by ganglion cells requires acetylcholine. Curare was released from Elvax, a slow-release polymer that was implanted in the eye. When spontaneous bursting was chronically blocked with curare in hatchlings, dark-induced expansion of receptive fields was abolished. Moreover, receptive fields of ganglion cells exposed to curare in hatchlings reared in normal light and dark cycles were smaller than normal.
CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that early, acetylcholine-dependent spontaneous bursts of activity control the outgrowth of receptive-field areas in retinal ganglion cells. The onset of visual experience induces the disappearance of the immature spontaneous bursts, resulting in the stabilization of receptive-field areas to their mature size.},

@article{Crair:1998,
	Abstract = {The role of experience in the development of the cerebral cortex has long been controversial. Patterned visual experience in the cat begins when the eyes open about a week after birth. Cortical maps for orientation and ocular dominance in the primary visual cortex of cats were found to be present by 2 weeks. Early pattern vision appeared unimportant because these cortical maps developed identically until nearly 3 weeks of age, whether or not the eyes were open. The na{\"\i}ve maps were powerfully dominated by the contralateral eye, and experience was needed for responses to the other eye to become strong, a process unlikely to be strictly Hebbian. With continued visual deprivation, responses to both eyes deteriorated, with a time course parallel to the well-known critical period of cortical plasticity. The basic structure of cortical maps is therefore innate, but experience is essential for specific features of these maps, as well as for maintaining the responsiveness and selectivity of cortical neurons.},

@article{Catsicas:1998,
	Abstract = {The development of the central nervous system is dependent on spontaneous action potentials and changes in [Ca2+]i occurring in neurons [1-4]. In the mammalian retina, waves of spontaneous electrical activity spread between retinal neurons, raising [Ca2+]i as they pass [5-7]. In the ferret retina, the first spontaneous Ca2+ waves have been reported at postnatal day 2 and are thought to result from the Ca2+ influx associated with bursts of action potentials seen in ganglion cells at this time [5-7]. These waves depend on depolarisation produced by voltage-gated sodium channels, but their initiation and/or propagation also depends upon nicotinic cholinergic synaptic transmission between amacrine cells and ganglion cells [8]. Here, we report contrasting results for the chick retina where Ca2+ transients are seen at times before retinal synapse formation but when there are extensive networks of gap junctions. These Ca2+ transients do not require nicotinic cholinergic transmission but are modulated by acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine and glycine. Furthermore, they propagate into the depth of the retina, suggesting that they are not restricted to ganglion and amacrine cells. The transients are abolished by the gap-junctional blocker octanol. Thus, the Ca2+ transients seen early in chick retinal development are triggered and propagate in the absence of synapses by a mechanism that involves several neurotransmitters and gap junctions.},

@article{Wong:1998,
	Abstract = {Even before birth and the onset of sensory experience, neural activity plays an important role in shaping the vertebrate nervous system. In the embryonic chick visual system, activity in the retina before vision has been implicated in the refinement of retinotopic maps, the elimination of transient projections, and the survival of a full complement of neurons. In this study, we report the detection of a physiological substrate for these phenomena: waves of spontaneous activity in the ganglion cell layer of the embryonic chick retina. The activity is robust and highly patterned, taking the form of large amplitude, rhythmic, and wide-ranging waves of excitation that propagate across the retina. Activity waves are most prominent and organized between embryonic days 13-18, coinciding with the developmental period during which retinal axons refine their connections in their targets. The spatial and temporal features of the patterns observed are consistent with the role of activity patterns in shaping eye-specific projections and retinotopic maps but inconsistent with the hypothesis that they specify lamina-specific projections in the tectum. Antagonists of glutamatergic and glycinergic transmission and of gap junctional communication suppress spontaneous activity, whereas antagonists to GABAergic transmission potentiate it. Based on these results, we propose that spontaneous activity in the ganglion cells is regulated by chemical inputs from both bipolar and amacrine cells and by gap junctional coupling involving ganglion cells.},

	Abstract = {Many pathways in the developing visual system are restructured and become highly organized even before vision occurs. Yet the developmental processes underlying the remodeling of visual connectivity are crucially dependent on retinal activity. Surprisingly, the immature and light-insensitive retina spontaneously generates a pattern of rhythmic bursting activity during the period when the connectivity patterns of retinal ganglion cells are shaped. Spatially, the activity is seen to spread across the retina in the form of waves that bring into synchrony the bursts of neighboring cells. Waves are present in the developing retina of higher and lower vertebrates, which suggests that this form of activity may be a common and fundamental mechanism employed in the activity-dependent refinement of early patterns of visual connections. Unraveling the cues encoded by the waves promises to provide important insights into how interactions driven by specific patterns of activity could lead to the modification of connectivity during development.},

	Abstract = {The properties of spontaneous activity in the developing visual pathway beyond the retina are unknown. Multielectrode recordings in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of awake behaving ferrets, before eye opening, revealed patterns of spontaneous activity that reflect a reshaping of retinal drive within higher visual stages. Significant binocular correlations were present only when cortico-thalamic feedback was intact. In the absence of retinal drive, cortico-thalamic feedback was required to sustain correlated LGN bursting. Activity originating from the contralateral eye drove thalamic activity far more strongly than that originating from the ipsilateral eye. Thus, in vivo patterns of LGN spontaneous activity emerge from interactions between retina, thalamus, and cortex.},

@article{King:2000,
	Abstract = {Many animals with laterally placed eyes, such as chameleons, move their eyes independently of one another. In contrast, primates with frontally placed eyes and binocular vision must move them together so that both eyes are aimed at the same point in visual space. Is binocular coordination an innate feature of how our brains are wired, or have we simply learned to move our eyes together? This question sparked a controversy in the 19(th) century between two eminent German scientists, Ewald Hering and Hermann von Helmholtz. Hering took the position that binocular coordination was innate and vigorously challenged von Helmholtz's view that it was learned. Hering won the argument and his hypothesis, known as Hering's Law of Equal Innervation, became generally accepted. New evidence suggests, however, that similar to chameleons, primates may program movements of each eye independently. Binocular coordination is achieved by a neural network at the motor periphery comprised of motoneurons and specialized interneurons located near or in the cranial nerve nuclei that innervate the extraocular muscles. It is assumed that this network must be trained and calibrated during infancy and probably throughout life in order to maintain the precise binocular coordination characteristic of primate eye movements despite growth, aging effects, and injuries to the eye movement neuromuscular system. Malfunction of this network or its ability to adaptively learn may be a contributing cause of strabismus.},

	Abstract = {A central hypothesis of neural development is that patterned activity drives the refinement of initially imprecise connections. We have examined this hypothesis directly by altering the frequency of spontaneous waves of activity that sweep across the mammalian retina prior to vision. Activity levels were increased in vivo using agents that elevate cAMP. When one eye is made more active, its layer within the LGN is larger despite the other eye having normal levels of activity. Remarkably, when the frequency of retinal waves is increased in both eyes, normally sized layers form. Because relative, rather than absolute, levels of activity between the eyes regulate the amount of LGN territory devoted to each eye, we conclude that activity acts instructively to guide binocular segregation during development.},

	Abstract = {Utilizing a multielectrode array to record spontaneous and visually evoked activity of cortical neurons in area 17, we investigate the relationship between long-range correlated spontaneous activity and functional ocular dominance columns during early ferret postnatal development (P24-P29). In regions of visual cortex containing alternating ocular dominance patches, periodic fluctuations in correlated activity are observed in which spontaneous activity is most highly correlated between cortical patches exhibiting the same eye preference. However, these fluctuations are present even within large contralateral eye-dominated bands which lack any periodic alternations in ocular dominance. Thus, the organization of ocular dominance columns cannot fully account for the patterns of correlated activity we observe. Our results suggest that patterns of long-range correlated activity reflect an intrinsic periodicity of cortical connectivity that is constrained by segregated eye-specific LGN afferents.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous activity patterns in the developing retina appear important for the functional organization of the visual system. We show here that an absence of early retinal waves in mice lacking the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is associated with both gain and loss of functional organization in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Anatomical studies show normal gross retinotopy in the beta2(-/-) dLGN but suggest reduced topographic precision in the retinogeniculate projection. Physiological recordings reveal normal topography in the dorsoventral visual axis but a lack of fine-scale mapping in the nasotemporal visual plane. In contrast, unlike wild-type mice, on- and off-center cells in the beta2(-/-) dLGN are spatially segregated. The presence of the beta2 subunit of the nAChR in the CNS is therefore important for normal functional organization in the retinogeniculate projection.},

	Abstract = {During retinocollicular map development, spontaneous waves of action potentials spread across the retina, correlating activity among neighboring retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). To address the role of retinal waves in topographic map development, we examined wave dynamics and retinocollicular projections in mice lacking the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. beta2(-/-) mice lack waves during the first postnatal week, but RGCs have high levels of uncorrelated firing. By P8, the wild-type retinocollicular projection remodels into a refined map characterized by axons of neighboring RGCs forming focal termination zones (TZs) of overlapping arbors. In contrast, in P8 beta2(-/-) mice, neighboring RGC axons form large TZs characterized by broadly distributed arbors. At P8, glutamatergic retinal waves appear in beta2(-/-) mice, and later, visually patterned activity appears, but the diffuse TZs fail to remodel. Thus, spontaneous retinal waves that correlate RGC activity are required for retinotopic map remodeling during a brief early critical period.},

	Abstract = {One of the seminal discoveries in developmental neuroscience is that altering visual experience through monocular deprivation can alter both the physiological and the anatomical representation of the two eyes, called ocular dominance columns, in primary visual cortex. This rearrangement is restricted to a critical period that starts a few days or weeks after vision is established and ends before adulthood. In contrast to the original hypothesis proposed by Hubel and Wiesel, ocular dominance columns are already substantially formed before the onset of the critical period. Indeed, before the critical period there is a period of ocular dominance column formation during which there is robust spontaneous activity and visual experience. Recent findings raise important questions about whether activity guides ocular dominance column formation in this 'precritical period'. One developmental event that marks the passage from the precritical period to the critical period is the activation of a GABAergic circuit. How these events trigger the transition from the precritical to critical period is not known.},

	Abstract = {During the development of the mammalian retinocollicular projection, a coarse retinotopic map is set up by the graded distribution of axon guidance molecules. Subsequent refinement of the initially diffuse projection has been shown to depend on the spatially correlated firing of retinal ganglion cells. In this scheme, the abolition of patterned retinal activity is not expected to influence overall retinotopic organization, but this has not been investigated. We used optical imaging of intrinsic signals to visualize the complete retinotopic map in the superior colliculus (SC) of mice lacking early retinal waves, caused by the deletion of the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. As expected from previous anatomical studies in the SC of beta2(-/-) mice, regions activated by individual visual stimuli were much larger and had less sharp borders than those in wild-type mice. Importantly, however, we also found systematic distortions of the entire retinotopic map: the map of visual space was expanded anteriorly and compressed posteriorly. Thus, patterned neuronal activity in the early retina has a substantial influence on the coarse retinotopic organization of the SC.},

	Abstract = {Although it is widely accepted that molecular mechanisms play an important role in the initial establishment of retinotopic maps, it has also long been argued that activity-dependent factors act in concert with molecular mechanisms to refine topographic maps. Evidence of a role for retinal activity in retinotopic map refinement in mammals is limited, and nothing is known about the effect of spontaneous retinal activity on the development of receptive fields in the superior colliculus. Using anatomical and physiological methods with two genetically manipulated mouse models and pharmacological interventions in wild-type mice, we show that spontaneous retinal waves instruct retinotopic map refinement in the superior colliculus of the mouse. Activity-dependent mechanisms may play a preferential role in the mapping of the nasal-temporal axis of the retina onto the colliculus, because refinement is particularly impaired along this axis in mutants without retinal waves. Interfering with both axon guidance cues and activity-dependent cues in the same animal has a dramatic cumulative effect. These experiments demonstrate how axon guidance cues and activity-dependent factors combine to instruct retinotopic map development.},

	Abstract = {The visual cortex is organized into retinotopic maps that preserve an orderly representation of the visual world, achieved by topographically precise inputs from the lateral geniculate nucleus. We show here that geniculocortical mapping is imprecise when the waves of spontaneous activity in the retina during the first postnatal week are disrupted genetically. This anatomical mapping defect is present by postnatal day 8 and has functional consequences, as revealed by optical imaging and microelectrode recording in adults. Pharmacological disruption of these retinal waves during the first week phenocopies the mapping defect, confirming both the site and the timing of the disruption in neural activity responsible for the defect. Analysis shows that the geniculocortical miswiring is not a trivial or necessary consequence of the retinogeniculate defect. Our findings demonstrate that disrupting early spontaneous activity in the eye alters thalamic connections to the cortex.},

First, neocortex is divided into anatomically distinct and functionally specialized areas that form a species-specific map. Second, neocortex is composed of layers that organize cortical connectivity. Recent studies of layer and area development have used time-lapse microscopy to follow cortical cell division and migration, gene arrays to find layer- or area- specific regulatory genes, time- and region- specific manipulations of candidate genes, and optical imaging to compare area maps in wild type with genetically altered mice. New observations clarify the molecular and cellular mechanisms that generate each pattern, and stress the links between layer and area formation.},

	Abstract = {Pharmacologically isolated starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in perinatal rabbit retinas spontaneously generated semiperiodic calcium spikes and long-lasting after-hyperpolarizations (AHPs), mediated by calcium-activated, cyclic AMP-sensitive potassium currents. These AHPs, rather than a depletion of neurotransmitters (as was previously believed), produced the refractory period of spontaneous retinal waves and set the upper limit of the wave frequency. Each SAC received inputs from roughly 10-30 neighboring SACs during a wave. These inputs synchronized and reshaped the intrinsic bursts to produce network oscillations at a rhythm different from that of individual SACs. With maturation, the semiperiodic bursts in SACs disappeared, owing to reduced intrinsic excitability and increased network inhibition. Thus, retinal waves are generated by a transient and specific network of cell-autonomous oscillators synchronized by reciprocally excitatory connections.},

	Abstract = {Many cortical synapses exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in which the precise timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes induces synaptic strengthening [long-term potentiation (LTP)] or weakening [long-term depression (LTD)]. Standard models posit a single, postsynaptic, NMDA receptor-based coincidence detector for LTP and LTD components of STDP. We show instead that STDP at layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapses in somatosensory (S1) cortex involves separate calcium sources and coincidence detection mechanisms for LTP and LTD. LTP showed classical NMDA receptor dependence. LTD was independent of postsynaptic NMDA receptors and instead required group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and calcium from voltage-sensitive channels and IP3 receptor-gated stores. Downstream of postsynaptic calcium, LTD required retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, leading to presynaptic LTD expression, and also required activation of apparently presynaptic NMDA receptors. These LTP and LTD mechanisms detected firing coincidence on approximately 25 and approximately 125 ms time scales, respectively, and combined to implement the overall STDP rule. These findings indicate that STDP is not a unitary process and suggest that endocannabinoid-dependent LTD may be relevant to cortical map plasticity.},

@article{Warland:2006,
	Abstract = {Correlated spontaneous activity in the form of retinal "waves" has been observed in a wide variety of developing animals, but whether retinal waves occur in the primate has not been determined previously. To address this issue, we recorded from isolated retinas using multielectrode arrays at six fetal ages: embryonic day 51 (E51), E55, E60, E67, E71, and E76. These recordings revealed that the fetal monkey retina is essentially silent at E51 and E55, with only few cells firing on rare occasions and without any obvious spatial or temporal order. Because previous work has shown that the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the dorsal lateral geniculate are selectively innervated during this early period, our results suggest that this process is unlikely to be regulated by retinal activity. Highly structured retinal waves were first observed at E60, >1 week before the segregation of eye-specific retinal dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus projections commences. The incidence of such waves decreased rapidly and progressively during the developmental period (E67-E76) when segregated eye-specific projections become established. Our findings indicate that retinal waves first occur in the fetal monkey at a remarkably early stage of development, >100 d before birth, and that this activity undergoes rapid changes in salient properties when eye-specific retinogeniculate projections are being formed.},

	Abstract = {During visual system development, the light-insensitive retina spontaneously generates waves of activity, which are transmitted to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The crucial question is whether retinal waves are further transmitted to the cortex and influence the early cortical patterns of activity. Using simultaneous recordings from the rat retina and visual cortex during the first postnatal week in vivo, we found that spontaneous retinal bursts are correlated with spindle bursts (intermittent network bursts associated with spindle-shape field oscillations) in the contralateral visual cortex (V1). V1 spindle bursts could be evoked by electrical stimulation of the optic nerve. Intraocular injection of forskolin, which augments retinal waves, increased the occurrence of V1 spindle bursts. Blocking propagation of retinal activity, or removal of the retina reduced the frequency, but did not completely eliminate the cortical spindle bursts. These results indicate that spontaneous retinal waves are transmitted to the visual cortex and trigger endogenous spindle bursts. We propose that the interaction between retinal waves and spindle bursts contributes to the development of visual pathways to the cortex.},

	Abstract = {Long-term plasticity typically relies on postsynaptic NMDA receptors to detect the coincidence of pre- and postsynaptic activity. Recent studies, however, have revealed forms of plasticity that depend on coincidence detection by presynaptic NMDA receptors. In the amygdala, cortical afferent associative presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) requires activation of presynaptic NMDA receptors by simultaneous thalamic and cortical afferents. Surprisingly, both types of afferent can also undergo postsynaptically induced NMDA-receptor-dependent LTP. In the neocortex, spike-timing-dependent long-term depression (LTD) requires simultaneous activation of presynaptic NMDA autoreceptors and retrograde signalling by endocannabinoids. In cerebellar LTD, presynaptic NMDA receptor activation suggests that similar presynaptic mechanisms may exist. Recent studies also indicate the existence of presynaptic coincidence detection that is independent of NMDA receptors, suggesting that such mechanisms have a widespread role in plasticity.},

	Abstract = {Sensory experience and spontaneous activity play important roles in development of sensory circuits; however, their relative contributions are unclear. Here, we test the role of different forms of activity on remodeling of the mouse retinogeniculate synapse. We found that the bulk of maturation occurs without patterned sensory activity over 4 days spanning eye opening. During this early developmental period, blockade of spontaneous retinal activity by tetrodotoxin, but not visual deprivation, retarded synaptic strengthening and inhibited pruning of excess retinal afferents. Later in development, synaptic remodeling becomes sensitive to changes in visually evoked activity, but only if there has been previous visual experience. Synaptic strengthening and pruning were disrupted by visual deprivation following 1 week of vision, but not by chronic deprivation from birth. Thus, spontaneous activity is necessary to drive the bulk of synaptic refinement around the time of eye opening, while sensory experience is important for the subsequent maintenance of connections.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms that give rise to ocular dominance columns (ODCs) during development are controversial. Early experiments indicated a key role for retinal activity in ODC formation. However, later studies showed that in those early experiments, the retinal activity perturbation was initiated after ODCs had already formed. Moreover, recent studies concluded that early eye removals do not impact ODC segregation. Here we blocked spontaneous retinal activity during the very early stages of ODC development. This permanently disrupted the anatomical organization of ODCs and led to a dramatic increase in receptive field size for binocular cells in primary visual cortex. Our data suggest that early spontaneous retinal activity conveys crucial information about whether thalamocortical axons represent one or the other eye and that this activity mediates binocular competition important for shaping receptive fields in primary visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates whether and to what extent vision with awareness is still possible in the whole visual field after loss of the occipital lobe of one or both cerebral hemispheres or after hemispherectomy in childhood. The visual functions of four children who suffered from unilateral or bilateral loss of the occipital lobe or who had been hemispherectomized were examined. The results show that even after unilateral loss of the striate and prestriate cortex the extent of the visual field may still be in the normal range. The residual visual functions may be mediated by intact extrastriate areas such as V5 and LO of the damaged cerebral hemisphere. It is also shown that even after complete hemispherectomy in early life the visual field may have a normal extent and that conscious visual perception in the whole visual field may be preserved. In hemispherectomized children, the remaining cerebral hemisphere or neural structures in the midbrain, including the superior colliculi and the praetectum, may be able to mediate these visual functions.},

	Abstract = {Eye-specific visual connections are a prominent model system for exploring how precise circuits develop in the CNS and, in particular, for addressing the role of neural activity in synapse elimination and axon refinement. Recent experiments have identified the features of spontaneous retinal activity that mediate eye-specific retinogeniculate segregation, the synaptic events associated with this process, and the importance of axon guidance cues for organizing the overall layout of eye-specific maps. The classic model of ocular dominance column development, in which spontaneous retinal activity plays a crucial role, has also gained new support. Although many outstanding questions remain, the mechanisms that instruct eye-specific circuit development are becoming clear.},

@article{Shah:2008,
	Abstract = {During development, spontaneous retinal waves are thought to provide an instructive signal for retinotopic map formation in the superior colliculus. In mice lacking the beta2 subunit of nicotinic ACh receptors (beta2-/-), correlated retinal waves are absent during the first postnatal week, but return during the second postnatal week. In control retinocollicular synapses, in vitro analysis reveals that AMPA/NMDA ratios and AMPA quantal amplitudes increase during the first postnatal week while the prevalence of silent synapses decreases. In age-matched beta2-/- mice, however, these parameters remain unchanged through the first postnatal week in the absence of retinal waves, but quickly mature to control levels by the end of the second week, suggesting that the delayed onset of correlated waves is able to drive synapse maturation. To examine whether such a mechanistic relationship exists, we applied a "burst-based" plasticity protocol that mimics coincident activity during retinal waves. We find that this pattern of activation is indeed capable of inducing synaptic strengthening [long-term potentiation (LTP)] on average across genotypes early in the first postnatal week [postnatal day 3 (P3) to P4] and, interestingly, that the capacity for LTP at the end of the first week (P6-P7) is significantly greater in immature beta2-/- synapses than in mature control synapses. Together, our results suggest that retinal waves drive retinocollicular synapse maturation through a learning rule that is physiologically relevant to natural wave statistics and that these synaptic changes may serve an instructive role during retinotopic map refinement.},

	Abstract = {Patterns of synaptic connections in the visual system are remarkably precise. These connections dictate the receptive field properties of individual visual neurons and ultimately determine the quality of visual perception. Spontaneous neural activity is necessary for the development of various receptive field properties and visual feature maps. In recent years, attention has shifted to understanding the mechanisms by which spontaneous activity in the developing retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, and visual cortex instruct the axonal and dendritic refinements that give rise to orderly connections in the visual system. Axon guidance cues and a growing list of other molecules, including immune system factors, have also recently been implicated in visual circuit wiring. A major goal now is to determine how these molecules cooperate with spontaneous and visually evoked activity to give rise to the circuits underlying precise receptive field tuning and orderly visual maps.},

@article{Huang:2008,
	Abstract = {GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition is crucial in neural circuit operations. In mammalian brains, the development of inhibitory synapses and innervation patterns is often a prolonged postnatal process, regulated by neural activity. Emerging evidence indicates that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acts beyond inhibitory transmission and regulates inhibitory synapse development. Indeed, GABA(A) receptors not only function as chloride channels that regulate membrane voltage and conductance but also play structural roles in synapse maturation and stabilization. The link from GABA(A) receptors to postsynaptic and presynaptic adhesion is probably mediated, partly by neuroligin-reurexin interactions, which are potent in promoting GABAergic synapse formation. Therefore, similar to glutamate signaling at excitatory synapse, GABA signaling may coordinate maturation of presynaptic and postsynaptic sites at inhibitory synapses. Defining the many steps from GABA signaling to receptor trafficking/stability and neuroligin function will provide further mechanistic insights into activity-dependent development and possibly plasticity of inhibitory synapses.},

The permanent loss of visual acuity (amblyopia) and anatomical remodeling within primary visual cortex following monocular deprivation is a classic example of critical period development from mouse to man. Recent work in rodents reveals a residual subthreshold potentiation of open eye response throughout life. Resetting excitatory-inhibitory balance or removing molecular 'brakes' on structural plasticity may unmask the potential for recovery of function in adulthood. Novel pharmacological or environmental interventions now hold great therapeutic promise based on a deeper understanding of critical period mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Genetic methods available in mice are likely to be powerful tools in dissecting cortical circuits. However, the visual cortex, in which sensory coding has been most thoroughly studied in other species, has essentially been neglected in mice perhaps because of their poor spatial acuity and the lack of columnar organization such as orientation maps. We have now applied quantitative methods to characterize visual receptive fields in mouse primary visual cortex V1 by making extracellular recordings with silicon electrode arrays in anesthetized mice. We used current source density analysis to determine laminar location and spike waveforms to discriminate putative excitatory and inhibitory units. We find that, although the spatial scale of mouse receptive fields is up to one or two orders of magnitude larger, neurons show selectivity for stimulus parameters such as orientation and spatial frequency that is near to that found in other species. Furthermore, typical response properties such as linear versus nonlinear spatial summation (i.e., simple and complex cells) and contrast-invariant tuning are also present in mouse V1 and correlate with laminar position and cell type. Interestingly, we find that putative inhibitory neurons generally have less selective, and nonlinear, responses. This quantitative description of receptive field properties should facilitate the use of mouse visual cortex as a system to address longstanding questions of visual neuroscience and cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous waves of activity propagating across large cortical areas may play important roles in sensory processing and circuit refinement. However, whether these waves are in turn shaped by sensory experience remains unclear. Here we report that visually evoked cortical activity reverberates in subsequent spontaneous waves. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging in rat visual cortex shows that following repetitive presentation of a given visual stimulus, spatiotemporal activity patterns resembling the evoked response appear more frequently in the spontaneous waves. This effect is specific to the response pattern evoked by the repeated stimulus, and it persists for several minutes without further visual stimulation. Such wave-mediated reverberation could contribute to short-term memory and help to consolidate the transient effects of recent sensory experience into long-lasting cortical modifications.},

	Abstract = {Gradients of molecular factors pattern the developing retina and superior colliculus (SC) and guide retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons to their appropriate central target perinatally. During and subsequent to this period, spontaneous waves of action potentials sweep across the retina, providing an instructive topographic signal based on the correlations of firing patterns of neighbouring RGCs. How these activity-independent and activity-dependent factors interact during retinotopic map formation remains unclear. A typical phenotype of mutant mice lacking genes for one or more RGC axon guidance molecules is the presence of topographically inappropriate projections or 'ectopic spots'. Here, we examine mice that lack functional bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPRs) in the retina. Retinal BMP controls the graded expression of RGC axon guidance molecules, resulting in some dorsal RGCs projecting ectopically to locations in the SC that normally receive input from ventral retina. We examine the consequences of this anatomical phenotype in vivo by studying the receptive field (RF) properties of neurons in the superficial SC. We observe a mixture of physiological phenotypes in BMPR mutant mice; notably we find some neurons with ectopic RFs displaced in elevation, corresponding to the observed anatomical defect. However, in a result not necessarily congruent with the presence of focal ectopic projections, some neurons have split, enlarged and patchy/distorted RFs. These results are consistent with the effects of spontaneous retinal waves acting upon a disrupted molecular template, and they place significant limits on the form of an activity-dependent learning rule for the development of retinocollicular projections.},

	Abstract = {A defining feature of the mammalian nervous system is its complex yet precise circuitry. The mechanisms which underlie the generation of neural connectivity are the topic of intense study in developmental neuroscience. The mammalian visual pathway demonstrates precise retinotopic organization in subcortical and cortical pathways, together with the alignment and matching of eye-specific projections, and sophisticated cortical circuitry that enables the extraction of features underlying vision. New approaches employing molecular-genetic analyses, transgenic mice, novel recombinant probes, and high-resolution imaging are contributing to rapid progress and a new synthesis in the field. These approaches are revealing the ways in which intrinsic patterning mechanisms act in concert with experience-dependent mechanisms to shape visual projections and circuits.},

	Abstract = {During development, retinal axons project coarsely within their visual targets before refining to form organized synaptic connections. Spontaneous retinal activity, in the form of acetylcholine-driven retinal waves, is proposed to be necessary for establishing these projection patterns. In particular, both axonal terminations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the size of receptive fields of target neurons are larger in mice that lack the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (beta2KO). Here, using a large-scale, high-density multielectrode array to record activity from hundreds of RGCs simultaneously, we present analysis of early postnatal retinal activity from both wild-type (WT) and beta2KO retinas. We find that beta2KO retinas have correlated patterns of activity, but many aspects of these patterns differ from those of WT retina. Quantitative analysis suggests that wave directionality, coupled with short-range correlated bursting patterns of RGCs, work together to refine retinofugal projections.},

	Abstract = {Sensory information is represented in the brain in the form of topographic maps, in which neighboring neurons respond to adjacent external stimuli. In the visual system, the superior colliculus receives topographic projections from the retina and primary visual cortex (V1) that are aligned. Alignment may be achieved through the use of a gradient of shared axon guidance molecules, or through a retinal-matching mechanism in which axons that monitor identical regions of visual space align. To distinguish between these possibilities, we take advantage of genetically engineered mice that we show have a duplicated functional retinocollicular map but only a single map in V1. Anatomical tracing revealed that the corticocollicular projection bifurcates to align with the duplicated retinocollicular map in a manner dependent on the normal pattern of spontaneous activity during development. These data suggest a general model in which convergent maps use coincident activity patterns to achieve alignment.},

@article{Ziburkus:2009,
	Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to determine whether retinal activity can support long-term changes in synaptic strength in the developing dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of thalamus. To test for this we made use of a rodent in vitro explant preparation in which retinal afferents and the intrinsic circuitry of the LGN remain intact. We repetitively stimulated the optic tract with a tetanus protocol that approximated the temporal features of spontaneous retinal waves. We found the amplitude of extracellular field potentials evoked by retinal stimulation changed significantly after tetanus and that the polarity of these alterations was related to postnatal age. At a time when substantial pruning of retinal connections occurs (postnatal day 1 [P1] to P14), high-frequency stimulation led to an immediate and long-term depression (LTD). However, at times when pruning wanes and adult-like patterns of connectivity are stabilizing (P16 to P30), the identical form of stimulation produced a modest form of potentiation (long-term potentiation [LTP]). The LTD was unaffected by the bath application of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. However, both LTD and LTP were blocked by L-type Ca(2+)-channel antagonists. Thus the Ca(2+) influx associated with L-type channel activation mediates the induction of synaptic plasticity and may signal the pruning and subsequent stabilization of developing retinogeniculate connections.},

	Abstract = {Patterned, spontaneous activity occurs in many developing neural circuits, including the retina, the cochlea, the spinal cord, the cerebellum and the hippocampus, where it provides signals that are important for the development of neurons and their connections. Despite there being differences in adult architecture and output across these various circuits, the patterns of spontaneous network activity and the mechanisms that generate it are remarkably similar. The mechanisms can include a depolarizing action of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), transient synaptic connections, extrasynaptic transmission, gap junction coupling and the presence of pacemaker-like neurons. Interestingly, spontaneous activity is robust; if one element of a circuit is disrupted another will generate similar activity.

	Abstract = {Callosal projection neurons, one of the major types of projection neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex, require neuronal activity for their axonal projections [H. Mizuno et al. (2007) J. Neurosci., 27, 6760-6770; C. L. Wang et al. (2007) J. Neurosci., 27, 11334-11342]. Here we established a method to label a few callosal axons with enhanced green fluorescent protein in the mouse cerebral cortex and examined the effect of pre-synaptic/post-synaptic neuron silencing on the morphology of individual callosal axons. Pre-synaptic/post-synaptic neurons were electrically silenced by Kir2.1 potassium channel overexpression. Single axon tracing showed that, after reaching the cortical innervation area, green fluorescent protein-labeled callosal axons underwent successive developmental stages: axon growth, branching, layer-specific targeting and arbor formation between post-natal day (P)5 and P9, and the subsequent elaboration of axon arbors between P9 and P15. Reducing pre-synaptic neuronal activity disturbed axon growth and branching before P9, as well as arbor elaboration afterwards. In contrast, silencing post-synaptic neurons disturbed axon arbor elaboration between P9 and P15. Thus, pre-synaptic neuron silencing affected significantly earlier stages of callosal projection neuron axon development than post-synaptic neuron silencing. Silencing both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons impaired callosal axon projections, suggesting that certain levels of firing activity in pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons are required for callosal axon development. Our findings provide in-vivo evidence that pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activities play critical, and presumably differential, roles in axon growth, branching, arbor formation and elaboration during cortical axon development.},

@article{Colonnese:2010,
	Abstract = {A primary feature of the preterm infant electroencephalogram is the presence of large infra-slow potentials containing rapid oscillations called slow activity transients (SATs). Such activity has not been described in animal models, and their generative mechanisms are unknown. Here we use direct-current and multisite extracellular, as well as whole-cell, recording in vivo to demonstrate the existence of regularly repeating SATs in the visual cortex of infant rats before eye opening. Present only in absence of anesthesia, SATs at postnatal day 10-11 were identifiable as a separate group of long-duration (approximately 10 s) events that consisted of large (>1 mV) negative local-field potentials produced by the summation of multiple bursts of rapid oscillatory activity (15-30 Hz). SATs synchronized the vast majority of neuronal activity (87\%) in the visual cortex before eye opening. Enucleation eliminated SATs, and their duration, interevent interval, and sub-burst structure matched those of phase III retinal waves recorded in vitro. Retinal waves, however, lacked rapid oscillations, suggesting that they arise centrally. Multielectrode recordings showed that SATs spread horizontally in cortex and synchronize activity at coactive locales via the rapid oscillations. SATs were clearly different from ongoing cortical activity, which was observable as a separate class of short bursts from postnatal day 9. Together, our data suggest that, in vivo, early cortical activity is primarily determined by peripheral inputs-retinal waves in visual cortex-that provide excitatory input, and by thalamocortical circuitry, which transforms this input to beta oscillations. We propose that the synchronous oscillations of SATs participate in the formation of visual circuitry.},

	Abstract = {Developing cortex generates endogenous activity that modulates the formation of functional units, but how this activity is altered to support mature function is poorly understood. Using recordings from the visual cortex of preterm human infants and neonatal rats, we report a "bursting" period of visual responsiveness during which the weak retinal output is amplified by endogenous network oscillations, enabling a primitive form of vision. This period ends shortly before delivery in humans and eye opening in rodents with an abrupt switch to the mature visual response. The switch is causally linked to the emergence of an activated state of continuous cortical activity dependent on the ascending neuromodulatory systems involved in arousal. This switch is sensory system specific but experience independent and also involves maturation of retinal processing. Thus, the early development of visual processing is governed by a conserved, intrinsic program that switches thalamocortical response properties in anticipation of patterned vision.},

	Abstract = {Corticostriatal projections constitute the main input to the basal ganglia, an ensemble of interconnected subcortical nuclei involved in procedural learning. Thus, long-term plasticity at corticostriatal synapses would provide a basic mechanism for the function of basal ganglia in learning and memory. We had previously reported the existence of a corticostriatal anti-Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at synapses onto striatal output neurons, the medium-sized spiny neurons. Here, we show that the blockade of GABAergic transmission reversed the time dependence of corticostriatal STDP. We explored the receptors and signalling mechanisms involved in the corticostriatal STDP. Although classical models for STDP propose NMDA receptors as the unique coincidence detector, the involvement of multiple coincidence detectors has also been demonstrated. Here, we show that corticostriatal STDP depends on distinct coincidence detectors. Specifically, long-term potentiation is dependent on NMDA receptor activation, while long-term depression requires distinct coincidence detectors: the phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbeta) and the inositol-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-gated calcium stores. Furthermore, we found that PLCbeta activation is controlled by group-I metabotropic glutamate receptors, type-1 muscarinic receptors and voltage-sensitive calcium channel activities. Activation of PLCbeta and IP3Rs leads to robust retrograde endocannabinoid signalling mediated by 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol and cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Interestingly, the same coincidence detectors govern the corticostriatal anti-Hebbian STDP and the Hebbian STDP reported at cortical synapses. Therefore, LTP and LTD induced by STDP at corticostriatal synapses are mediated by independent signalling mechanisms, each one being controlled by distinct coincidence detectors.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous, highly rhythmic episodes of propagating bursting activity are present early during the development of chick and mouse spinal cords. Acetylcholine, and GABA and glycine, which are both excitatory at this stage, provide the excitatory drive. It was previously shown that a moderate decrease in the frequency of bursting activity, caused by in ovo application of the GABA(A) receptor blocker, picrotoxin, resulted in motoneurons making dorsal-ventral (D-V) pathfinding errors in the limb and in the altered expression of guidance molecules associated with this decision. To distinguish whether the pathfinding errors were caused by perturbation of the normal frequency of bursting activity or interference with GABA(A) receptor signaling, chick embryos were chronically treated in ovo with picrotoxin to block GABA(A) receptors, while light activation by channelrhodopsin-2 was used to restore bursting activity to the control frequency. The restoration of normal patterns of neural activity in the presence of picrotoxin prevented the D-V pathfinding errors in the limb and maintained the normal expression levels of EphA4, EphB1, and polysialic acid on neural cell adhesion molecule, three molecules previously shown to be necessary for this pathfinding choice. These observations demonstrate that developing spinal motor circuits are highly sensitive to the precise frequency and pattern of spontaneous activity, and that any drugs that alter this activity could result in developmental defects.},

	Abstract = {We combined fixed-tissue and time-lapse analyses to investigate the axonal branching phenomena underlying the development of topographically organized ipsilateral projections from area 17 to area 18a in the rat. These complementary approaches allowed us to relate static, large-scale information provided by traditional fixed-tissue analysis to highly dynamic, local, small-scale branching phenomena observed with two-photon time-lapse microscopy in acute slices of visual cortex. Our fixed-tissue data revealed that labeled area 17 fibers invaded area 18a gray matter at topographically restricted sites, reaching superficial layers in significant numbers by postnatal day 6 (P6). Moreover, most parental axons gave rise to only one or occasionally a small number of closely spaced interstitial branches beneath 18a. Our time-lapse data showed that many filopodium-like branches emerged along parental axons in white matter or deep layers in area 18a. Most of these filopodial branches were transient, often disappearing after several minutes to hours of exploratory extension and retraction. These dynamic behaviors decreased significantly from P4, when the projection is first forming, through the second postnatal week, suggesting that the expression of, or sensitivity to, cortical cues promoting new branch addition in the white matter is developmentally down-regulated coincident with gray matter innervation. Together, these data demonstrate that the development of topographically organized corticocortical projections in rats involves extensive exploratory branching along parental axons and invasion of cortex by only a small number of interstitial branches, rather than the widespread innervation of superficial cortical layers by an initially exuberant population of branches.},

	Abstract = {If the classical functional attribute of cortical GABAergic interneurons is to mediate synaptic inhibition in the adult cortex, it is becoming evident that their major task is instead to shape the spatio-temporal dynamics of the network oscillations that support most brain functions. This complex function involves a division of labour between morpho-physiologically diverse interneuron subtypes. Both the central network function and the bewildering heterogeneity of the interneuron population are especially emphasized during cortical development: at early postnatal stages, a single GABAergic neuron can efficiently pace the activity of hundreds of other cells, whereas some interneuron subtypes are still poorly developed. Given the role of coherent activity in brain development, this confers to GABAergic interneurons a major role in the proper maturation of cortical networks.},

	Abstract = {The maturation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon projections in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and the superior colliculus (SC) relies on both molecular and activity-dependent mechanisms. Despite the increasing popularity of the mouse as a mammalian visual system model, little is known in this species about the normal development of individual RGC axon arbors or the role of activity in this process. We used a novel in vivo single RGC labeling technique to quantitatively characterize the elaboration and refinement of RGC axon arbors in the dLGN and SC in wild-type (WT) and β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors mutant (β2(-/-)) mice, which have perturbed retinal waves, during the developmental period when eye-specific lamination and retinotopic refinement occurs. Our results suggest that eye-specific segregation and retinotopic refinement in WT mice are not the result of refinement of richly exuberant arbors but rather the elaboration of arbors prepositioned in the proper location combined with the elimination of inappropriately targeted sparse branches. We found that retinocollicular arbors mature ∼1 week earlier than retinogeniculate arbors, although RGC axons reach the dLGN and SC at roughly the same age. We also observed striking differences between contralateral and ipsilateral RGC axon arbors in the SC but not in the LGN. These data suggest a strong influence of target specific cues during arbor maturation. In β2(-/-) mice, we found that retinofugal single axon arbors are well ramified but enlarged, particularly in the SC, indicating that activity-dependent visual map development occurs through the refinement of individual RGC arbors.},

	Abstract = {Complex neural circuits in the mammalian brain develop through a combination of genetic instruction and activity-dependent refinement. The relative role of these factors and the form of neuronal activity responsible for circuit development is a matter of significant debate. In the mammalian visual system, retinal ganglion cell projections to the brain are mapped with respect to retinotopic location and eye of origin. We manipulated the pattern of spontaneous retinal waves present during development without changing overall activity levels through the transgenic expression of β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in retinal ganglion cells of mice. We used this manipulation to demonstrate that spontaneous retinal activity is not just permissive, but instructive in the emergence of eye-specific segregation and retinotopic refinement in the mouse visual system. This suggests that specific patterns of spontaneous activity throughout the developing brain are essential in the emergence of specific and distinct patterns of neuronal connectivity.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms by which experience guides refinement of converging afferent pathways are poorly understood. We describe a vision-driven refinement of corticocollicular inputs that determines the consolidation of retinal and visual cortical (VC) synapses on individual neurons in the superficial superior colliculus (sSC). Highly refined corticocollicular terminals form 1-2 days after eye-opening (EO), accompanied by VC-dependent filopodia sprouting on proximal dendrites, and PSD-95 and VC-dependent quadrupling of functional synapses. Delayed EO eliminates synapses, corticocollicular terminals, and spines on VC-recipient dendrites. Awake recordings after EO show that VC and retina cooperate to activate sSC neurons, and VC light responses precede sSC responses within intervals promoting potentiation. Eyelid closure is associated with more protracted cortical visual responses, causing the majority of VC spikes to follow those of the colliculus. These data implicate spike-timing plasticity as a mechanism for cortical input survival, and support a cooperative strategy for retinal and cortical coinnervation of the sSC.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies of the ferret visual cortex indicate that the development of direction selectivity requires visual experience. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging to study the development of direction selectivity in layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse visual cortex in vivo. Surprisingly, just after eye opening nearly all orientation-selective neurons were also direction selective. During later development, the number of neurons responding to drifting gratings increased in parallel with the fraction of neurons that were orientation, but not direction, selective. Our experiments demonstrate that direction selectivity develops normally in dark-reared mice, indicating that the early development of direction selectivity is independent of visual experience. Furthermore, remarkable functional similarities exist between the development of direction selectivity in cortical neurons and the previously reported development of direction selectivity in the mouse retina. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that the development of orientation and direction selectivity in the mouse brain is distinctly different from that in ferrets.},

	Abstract = {Binocular competition is thought to drive eye-specific segregation in the developing visual system, potentially through Hebbian synaptic learning rules that are sensitive to correlations in afferent activity. Altering retinal activity can disrupt eye-specific segregation, but little is known about the temporal features of binocular activity that modulate visual map development. We used optogenetic techniques to directly manipulate retinal activity in vivo and identified a critical period before eye opening in mice when specific binocular features of retinal activity drive visual map development. Synchronous activation of both eyes disrupted segregation, whereas asynchronous stimulation enhanced segregation. The optogenetic stimulus applied was spatially homogenous; accordingly, retinotopy of ipsilateral projections was markedly perturbed, but contralateral retinotopy was unaffected or even improved. These results provide direct evidence that the synchrony and precise temporal pattern of binocular retinal activity during a critical period in development regulates eye-specific segregation and retinotopy in the developing visual system.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous network activity constitutes a central theme during the development of neuronal circuitry [1, 2]. Before the onset of vision, retinal neurons generate waves of spontaneous activity that are relayed along the ascending visual pathway [3, 4] and shape activity patterns in these regions [5, 6]. The spatiotemporal nature of retinal waves is required to establish precise functional maps in higher visual areas, and their disruption results in enlarged axonal projection areas (e.g., [7-10]). However, how retinal inputs shape network dynamics in the visual cortex on the cellular level is unknown. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we identified two independently occurring patterns of network activity in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) before and at the onset of vision. Acute manipulations of spontaneous retinal activity revealed that one type of network activity largely originated in the retina and was characterized by low synchronicity (L-) events. In addition, we identified a type of high synchronicity (H-) events that required gap junction signaling but were independent of retinal input. Moreover, the patterns differed in wave progression and developmental profile. Our data suggest that different activity patterns have complementary functions during the formation of synaptic circuits in the developing visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {Retinal input plays an important role in the specification of topographically organized circuits and neuronal response properties, but the mechanism and timing of this effect is not known in most species. A system that shows dramatic dependence on retinal influences is the interhemispheric connection through the corpus callosum. Using ferrets, we analyzed the extent to which development of the visual callosal pattern depends on retinal influences, and explored the period during which these influences are required for normal pattern formation. We studied the mature callosal patterns in normal ferrets and in ferrets bilaterally enucleated (BE) at postnatal day 7 (P7) or P20. Callosal patterns were revealed in tangential sections from unfolded and flattened brains following multiple injections of horseradish peroxidase in the opposite hemisphere. We also estimated the effect of enucleation on the surface areas of striate and extrastriate visual cortex by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from intact brains. In BEP7 ferrets we found that the pattern of callosal connections was highly anomalous and the sizes of both striate and extrastriate visual cortex were significantly reduced. In contrast, enucleation at P20 had no significant effect on the callosal pattern, but it still caused a reduction in the size of striate and extrastriate visual cortex. Finally, retinal deafferentation had no significant effect on the number of visual callosal neurons. These results indicate that the critical period during which the eyes influence the development of callosal patterns, but not the size of visual cortex, ends by P20 in the ferret.},

	Abstract = {Developing amphibians need vision to avoid predators and locate food before visual system circuits fully mature. Xenopus tadpoles can respond to visual stimuli as soon as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) innervate the brain, however, in mammals, chicks and turtles, RGCs reach their central targets many days, or even weeks, before their retinas are capable of vision. In the absence of vision, activity-dependent refinement in these amniote species is mediated by waves of spontaneous activity that periodically spread across the retina, correlating the firing of action potentials in neighboring RGCs. Theory suggests that retinorecipient neurons in the brain use patterned RGC activity to sharpen the retinotopy first established by genetic cues. We find that in both wild type and albino Xenopus tadpoles, RGCs are spontaneously active at all stages of tadpole development studied, but their population activity never coalesces into waves. Even at the earliest stages recorded, visual stimulation dominates over spontaneous activity and can generate patterns of RGC activity similar to the locally correlated spontaneous activity observed in amniotes. In addition, we show that blocking AMPA and NMDA type glutamate receptors significantly decreases spontaneous activity in young Xenopus retina, but that blocking GABA(A) receptor blockers does not. Our findings indicate that vision drives correlated activity required for topographic map formation. They further suggest that developing retinal circuits in the two major subdivisions of tetrapods, amphibians and amniotes, evolved different strategies to supply appropriately patterned RGC activity to drive visual circuit refinement.},

	Abstract = {Hubel and Wiesel began the modern study of development and plasticity of primary visual cortex (V1), discovering response properties of cortical neurons that distinguished them from their inputs and that were arranged in a functional architecture. Their findings revealed an early innate period of development and a later critical period of dramatic experience-dependent plasticity. Recent studies have used rodents to benefit from biochemistry and genetics. The roles of spontaneous neural activity and molecular signaling in innate, experience-independent development have been clarified, as have the later roles of visual experience. Plasticity produced by monocular visual deprivation (MD) has been dissected into stages governed by distinct signaling mechanisms, some of whose molecular players are known. Many crucial questions remain, but new tools for perturbing cortical cells and measuring plasticity at the level of changes in connections among identified neurons now exist. The future for the study of V1 to illuminate cortical development and plasticity is bright.},

	Abstract = {The morphological and functional development of the vertebrate nervous system is initially governed by genetic factors and subsequently refined by neuronal activity. However, fundamental features of the nervous system emerge before sensory experience is possible. Thus, activity-dependent development occurring before the onset of experience must be driven by spontaneous activity, but the origin and nature of activity in vivo remains largely untested. Here we use optical methods to show in live neonatal mice that waves of spontaneous retinal activity are present and propagate throughout the entire visual system before eye opening. This patterned activity encompassed the visual field, relied on cholinergic neurotransmission, preferentially initiated in the binocular retina and exhibited spatiotemporal correlations between the two hemispheres. Retinal waves were the primary source of activity in the midbrain and primary visual cortex, but only modulated ongoing activity in secondary visual areas. Thus, spontaneous retinal activity is transmitted through the entire visual system and carries patterned information capable of guiding the activity-dependent development of complex intra- and inter-hemispheric circuits before the onset of vision.},

@article{Sarnaik:2013,
	Abstract = {The convergence of eye-specific thalamic inputs to visual cortical neurons forms the basis of binocular vision. Inputs from the same eye that signal light increment (On) and decrement (Off) are spatially segregated into subregions, giving rise to cortical receptive fields (RFs) that are selective for stimulus orientation. Here we map RFs of binocular neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex using spike-triggered average. We find that subregions of the same sign (On-On and Off-Off) preferentially overlap between the 2 monocular RFs, leading to binocularly matched orientation tuning. We further demonstrate that such subregion correspondence and the consequent matching of RF orientation are disrupted in mice reared in darkness during development. Surprisingly, despite the lack of all postnatal visual experience, a substantial degree of subregion correspondence still remains. In addition, dark-reared mice show normal monocular RF structures and binocular overlap. These results thus reveal the specific roles of experience-dependent and -independent processes in binocular convergence and refinement of On and Off inputs onto single cortical neurons.},

	Abstract = {Brain connections are organized into topographic maps that are precisely aligned both within and across modalities. This alignment facilitates coherent integration of different categories of sensory inputs and allows for proper sensorimotor transformations. Topographic maps are established and aligned by multistep processes during development, including interactions of molecular guidance cues expressed in gradients; spontaneous activity-dependent axonal and dendritic remodeling; and sensory-evoked plasticity driven by experience. By focusing on the superior colliculus, a major site of topographic map alignment for different sensory modalities, this review summarizes current understanding of topographic map development in the mammalian visual system and highlights recent advances in map alignment studies. A major goal looking forward is to reveal the molecular and synaptic mechanisms underlying map alignment and to understand the physiological and behavioral consequences when these mechanisms are disrupted at various scales. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Neuroscience Volume 36 is July 08, 2013. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates.},
