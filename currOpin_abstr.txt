# Abstract

The structural and functional development of visual circuits in reptiles, birds, and mammals happens largely independent of sensory experience. Innate genetic programs code for gradients of molecules which provide gross positional information for developing nerve cells, yet much of the cytoarchitectural complexity and synaptogenesis of neurons depends on calcium influx, neurotransmitter release, and neural activity before the start of vision. In fact, specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity, retinal waves, emerge among the earliest connections made between excitable cells in the developing eye. These patterns of spontaneous activity, which have been recorded from all amniote retinae examined to date, may be an evolved adaptation for species having long gestational periods before the start of vision, imparting an informational robustness and redundancy for the development of visual maps across the nervous system. Recent experiments indicate that retinal waves play a crucial role in the development of interconnections between different parts of the visual system, suggesting that these spontaneous patterns serve as a template-matching mechanism to prepare higher-order visually-associative circuits for the onset of visuomotor learning and behavior. Key questions in future studies will include determining the exact sources and nature of spontaneous activity during development, characterizing the interactions between neural activity and transcriptional regulation, and understanding the extent of circuit connectivity governed by retinal waves within and between sensory-motor systems.
