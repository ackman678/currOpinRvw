# Abstract

The structural and functional development of visual circuits in reptiles, birds, and mammals occurs largely independent of sensory experience. Proper visual map formation depends not only on innate genetic programs, but also on factors intrinsic to the cellular environment such as spontaneous electrical activity among excitable cells.  Innate genetic prgarams code for gradients of trophic molecules which provide a wealth of positional information for developing axons, yet much of the structural complexity and synapse formations occur in aYet proper formation of visual maps proceeds in a neural activity-dependent fashion before vision. Indeed, neurotransmitter release and specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity emerge in the initial  circuits serving as a template matching mech  in the cellular evnroeonmetn setup by intrinsic genetic programs. Recent studies have demonstrated the remarkable complexity if info that these patterns contain and indicate that a they likely play a key role in establishment of higher order circuits in across the developing nervous system. Key questions pertaining to the exact sources and nature of spontaneous activity in the brain, the range of developmental processes they govern within and between sensori-motor systems, and their synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms of action will be important to address in the near future.
