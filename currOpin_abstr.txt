# Abstract

The structural and functional development of visual circuits in reptiles, birds, and mammals occurs largely independent of sensory experience. Proper visual map formation depends not only on innate genetic programs, but also on factors intrinsic to the cellular environment such as spontaneous electrical activity among excitable cells. Innate genetic programs code for gradients of trophic molecules which provide gross positional information for developing neurons and axons, yet much of the cytoarchitectural complexity and synaptogenesis depends on calcium influx, neurotransmitter release, and neural activity before the start of vision. Indeed, neurotransmitter release and specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity called retinal waves, emerge within the peripheral visual circuits inititally established by positional info coddd by trphic gradients that provide a robustness and redundancy to the visual system for serving and may have a conserved evolutionary role as a template matching mechanism  in the cellular environment setup by intrinsic genetic programs. Recent studies have demonstrated the remarkable range of complex information that these patterns contain and suggest that they likely play a key role in establishment of higher order circuits across the developing nervous system. Key questions pertaining to the exact sources and nature of spontaneous activity in the brain, the range of developmental processes they govern within and between sensori-motor systems, and their synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms of action will be important to address into the future.
