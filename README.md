# Workflow

1. Clone this currOpinRvw GitHub repository to your local machine. You will want the GitHub application installed. I suggest keeping the your local repository of this project in a personal Dropbox folder, so that your copy is sync'd between your devices and you can work anywhere. 
2. Then just write and make changes! Lets work with `currOpin_main.txt` as our main manuscript document for now. We can do page layout and formatting in Word later.
3. Then when you are at your primary computer with the GitHub application installed, press the 'Commit' button in GitHub and add a brief commit message on your changes.
4. Sync the changes back to the remote shared repository. 
	* Everything is versioned using this git based workflow and we can seamlessly merge changes, revert changes, and make selective merges by looking at the diff. 


# Info
*  The `currOpin_main.txt` file is just a plain text file you can work in any text editing application. 
    * For Mac OSX TextEdit or [WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) Byword is recommended. 
    * For iOS WriteRoom, Byword, Notesy, or Nebulous Notes is recommended. 
    * For Windows, Notepad++ is recommended.
    * If you prefer to write in Microsoft Word, just make sure to save as **plain** text file for now.

* This main.txt file uses ['Markdown' style formatting](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) which is completely optional (that is how the document and outline and even this README is currently formatted. GitHub is very markdown friendly).

* Since `currOpin_outline.md` file also in markdown format and was rendered as html and pdf and saved using the [Marked](http://markedapp.com) markdown preview application. 

* The .md extension is just an alternative to the .txt extension for plain text files to help applications know when a file should be rendered using markdown formatting.
