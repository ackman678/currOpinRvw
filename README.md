# Workflow

1. Clone this currOpinRvw GitHub repository to your local machine. You will want the GitHub application installed. I suggest keeping it locally in a personal Dropbox folder, so that your copy is synced between your devices and you can work anywhere. 
2. Then write and make changes-- lets work with `currOpin_main.txt` as our manuscript document for now. We can do page layout and formatting in Word later.
3. Then when you are at your primary computer with the GitHub application installed, press the 'Commit' button in GitHub and add a brief commit message on your changes.
4. Sync the changes back to the remote shared repository. 
	* Everything is versioned using this git based workflow and we can seamlessly merge changes, revert changes, and make selective merges by looking at the diff. 


# Information
Since it's just a plain text file you can work in a text editing application like TextEdit or [WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) is recommended. If you prefer to write in Word, just make sure to save as **plain** text file for now.

You can use ['Markdown' style formatting](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (that is how the document and outline and even this README is currently formatted. GitHub is very markdown friendly).

The `currOpin_outline.txt` file is also in markdown format and was rendered as html and pdf and saved using the [Marked](http://markedapp.com) markdown preview application.
